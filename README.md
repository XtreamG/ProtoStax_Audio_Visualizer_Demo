# ProtoStax_Audio_Visualizer_Demo
Demo for ProtoStax Audio Visualizer with Spectrum Shield, NeoPixel Shield and Arduino

![ProtoStax Audio Visualizer Demo](ProtoStax_Audio_Visualizer_Demo.gif)

using [ProtoStax for Arduino](https://www.protostax.com/products/protostax-for-arduino)

## Prerequisites

This demo uses
* [Adafruit NeoPixel Shield for Arduino](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1430)
* [SparkFun Spectrum Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13116)
* [ProtoStax for Arduino](https://www.protostax.com/products/protostax-for-arduino)
* Arduino (Uno), but you can use other form factors that fit a Shield

For further instructions, see the [RGB Matrix Audio Visualizer with
Arduino](https://www.hackster.io/sridhar-rajagopal/rgb-matrix-audio-visualizer-with-arduino-845062) Tutorial at [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/sridhar-rajagopal/rgb-matrix-audio-visualizer-with-arduino-845062)

## Installing

This demo uses the Adafruit_NeoMatrix library - see [https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoMatrix](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoMatrix)
It also uses SparkFun's Spectrum Shield and has taken notes from its
GitHub example (no separate library required) - see [https://github.com/sparkfun/Spectrum_Shield](https://github.com/sparkfun/Spectrum_Shield)

```
Arduino IDE->Sketch->Include LIbrary->Manage Libraries - choose
Adafruit_NeoMatrix and install it
git clone https://github.com/protostax/ProtoStax_Audio_Visualizer_Demo.git
```

## Usage

See instructions in Tutorial linked above for putting together shields and
enclosure. 

```
open
ProtoStax_Audio_Visualizer_Demo/ProtoStax_Audio_Visualizer_Demo.ino in
Arduino IDE
compile sketch and upload to your Arduino
```
